# Enigma I

- Reichswehr / Wehrmacht
- 3 out of 5 selected wheels
- QWERTZ layout
- Was used by the Heer (Army) and Luftwaffe (Air Force), and
  later adopted by the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) where it became
  known as the M1, M2 and finally the M3.
- Difference between the army and the navy version was that
  the wheels of the latter have letters (A-Z) rather than numbers.
- Each wheel has a single notch on its circumference which
  introduces the "Enigma stepping" movement.

- Grundstellung (Daily key)
- Eintrittswalze (Entry wheel) (ETW)
- Umkehrwalze - (Reflector or UKW) (USUALLY MARKED WITH B OR C)

- Sending a message with an Enigma machine involves
  the setting of two cryptographic keys: (1) the daily key and
  (2) the message key. The daily key was setup once a day at midnight.

## Wiring

- UKW-A was used before WWII
- UKW-B was the standard reflector during the war
- UKW-C was only temporarily used during the war
- The wiring of all 5 wheels is identical to the wiring
  of the first 5 wheels of the Enigma M3 (Used by the Kriegsmarine)
  and the U-Boot Enigma M4.

# Enigma M3

- M1 (1934), M2 (1938), and M3 (1940) were generally known as M3
- were used by the German Navy (Kriegsmarine).
- was compatible with the Enigma I that was used by the
  Army and the Luftwaffe
- The cipher wheels have letters instead of numbers
- in 1940, it was replaced by the M3
- First five cipher wheels were wired identically to the five
  wheels of the Wehrmacht's Enigma I.
- In 1939, three more wheels were added - VI, VII and VIII
  which were used **exclusively** by the Kriegsmarine. They
  were not supplied to the rest of the German Army.
- Later, (1942) the Kriegsmarine unexpectedly started
  using the 4-wheel Enigma M4 on its U-Boat and battleship networks.
  The rest of the Kriegsmarine kept using the Enigma M3.
- All naval machines had 8 wheels to choose from.
- 3 of 8 at any time
- There were instruction that one of the 3 wheels in the machine had to be a Naval wheel (VI-VIII) and that that particular naval wheel could not be used in the same position on two successive days.
- I to V have one turnover notch, but the three extra Naval wheels (VI-VIII) each have two notches
- 1944 UKW-D, field-rewirable reflector is introduces by the
  Luftwaffe, replaces the existing reflector (B or C)

## Wiring

In the column Notch the position is given of the turnover notch on the circumference of the wheel, whilst the column Turnover shows which letter (or number) is visible in the window at that time.

M3 vs Enigma I

- Letters on the wheels rather than numbers
- Different ring setting mechanism
- Separate lamp panel (hinged on the M2)
- Lockable wheel cover with two locks
- Removable top lid (of the wooden case)
- Plugs with longer pins (incompatible with Enigma I plugboard)
- Lock in top lid of wooden case rather than in the flap at the front
- Two grips at the sides (for pulling the machine out of a bay)
- 6V circular power socket (M1, M2), or two sockets for 4V and 220V (M3)

## Terminology

- Stator / Entrittswalze (ETW) = Static Wheel
- Umkehrwalze (UKW) = Reflector Wheel
- Walzenlage = Wheel Order
- Ringstellung = Ring Setting
- Grundstellung = Ground Setting (start position / indicator settings)
- Steckerbrett = Plugboard

The operator would then think of three letters at random, say RNF,
for the Grundstellung or indicator-setting. He would then manually rotate the
left rotor until it had R uppermost, the middle rotor until it had N uppermost and the right rotor until it had F uppermost.

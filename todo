# Keyboard
- [X] Every clicked button should print the letter it's assigned to.

# Plugboard
- [ ] Letters should be on top of the circle
- [ ] Every clicked plug, should be logged as "last clicked plug",
if another plug is clicked, they should swap places (point to eachother)
- [ ] On plug (circle) click, the circle should be colored with a unique color (one of 13 colors) or
it should have one color and a functionallity to draw a line to the next letter. This would indicate
that a letter is swapped.
- [ ] If a plug is swapped, but is clicked again, it should remove the swap and assign the swapped
letters to itselves.
